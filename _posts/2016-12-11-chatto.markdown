## Description

Chatto is a single-page application that allows users to chat in real-time with each other in various chat rooms. The application first prompts a user to enter a username via a modal and then saves it to the browser with cookies. Once a username is set, the user can easily click to enter any rooms that they want to chat in, or create a new room.

## Tools/Skills

This application was built with AngularJS. It also uses:

* Firebase for real time room creation and sending messages
* UI Bootstrap's $uibModal service
* Cookies for setting & validating usernames
* UI-Router
* Grunt
* NodeJS
* HTML/CSS
