## Description

This version of Kioku is built from scratch with Ruby on Rails. It is a self-destructing to-do list. This utility application uses rake automation to remove to-do items that are over 7 days old. The logic is that if the task has not been completed in a week, it is not important enough to be on a to-do list. The intention is to motivate users to complete their tasks ASAP and keep their lists up-to-date and relevant.

## Tools/Skills

This application was built with Ruby on Rails. It also uses:

* jQuery
* AJAX
* HTML/CSS/SASS
* Bootstrap
* Devise library for user authentication
* SQLite3 for development and PostgreSQL for production


## Test it Out
