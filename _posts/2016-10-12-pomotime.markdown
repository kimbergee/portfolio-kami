PomoTime is a single-page application that offers a work and break timer to help users work efficiently. Based on the Pomodoro technique, a user can start/reset a 25 minute work session. Only after a full work session has been completed, will the timer for a 5 minute break display. After 4 completed work sessions, a longer 30 minute break timer will display for the user.
