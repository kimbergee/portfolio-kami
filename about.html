<div class="about-me">
  <p>Hello. My name is Kimber and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Boston.
    Before becoming a developer, I was working in the digital marketing space.
    I worked with a small tech start up for a while, where I worked closely with
    the developers. Seeing how and what they did to build the products that I was
    marketing, made me realize that I wanted to do that as well- solve problems,
    make things work, and create things that people like to use. In my experience,
    there is often a disconnect between marketers and programmers because they have
    difficulty understanding each other. With my experience in both spaces, I try to build
    a bridge between the two and always keep a marketing mindset when developing apps.
    I have worked with building both backend & frontend projects, but enjoy frontend
    development & design the most.

  <p>When I'm not coding, I can most likely be found playing or taking photos of my
    two rescue pups, Luna and Arnold (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lunathetoona">@lunathetoona</a>).
    I am also a freelance writer and you can find some of my articles on The Huffington Post,
    BarkPost, and The Dodo.
