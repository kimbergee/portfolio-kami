<div class="about-me">
  <p>Hello. My name is Kimber and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer based in Boston, MA.
    Before becoming a developer, I worked on digital marketing solutions for a number
    of organizations and most recently a small data analytics tech startup.
  </p>
  <p>
    Throughout my career, I've collaborated closely with development teams and in
    doing so, became fascinated with the process by which programmers created useful
    products that people loved using. I also realized that there were often inefficiencies
    between the work of marketing teams and programmers due to the lack of a common language.
    As a result, I'm now working to bridge this gap, approaching all of my development
    projects with a marketing and user-focused mindset. I have experience working
    on both front & backend projects, and find a particular enjoyment in the aspects of
    frontend development and design.
  </p>

  <p>When I'm not coding, I can most likely be found playing with or taking photos of my
    two rescue pups, Luna and Arnold (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/lunathetoona">@lunathetoona</a>).
    I am also a freelance writer and you can find some of my articles on The Huffington Post,
    BarkPost, and The Dodo.
